Conclusion: 

To conclude this activity and final requirement, I have learned a lot especially on how to deploy the model. The model I used was the midterm exam, "Multi-class Weather" 
data set in which we used MLP to create a deep learning model to predict the classes out of the photos in the data set. 
I was able to create a model that is inaccurate but is enough to be in streamlit. 
I noticed that when you are trying to use a model for deployment that is large, Streamlit may not be able to handle it.
That's what I did, my original model was around 1gb and it presented an error. 
I debugged the model architecture, changed the sizes from 256 x 256 to 64x64.
The model I went with was around 4mb, relatively small but it gets the job done. I followed the guide that you've presented to us, sir. 
I was able to deploy my model thanks to it. There were some errors and bugs along the way as well,
I was perplexed as to why my model was deploying on my local host and not on streamlit, 
it says I was missing some dependancies specifically tensorflow. So what I did was create a txt called requirements.txt as shown in your 
video as well although it wasn't mentioned I stil saw the txt in the github repository and searched how to import dependancies that way. All in al, creating and deploying a model is a great way 
for the community to learn more and see what's in store for deep learning.
